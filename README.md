# ML-KNN-Artificial-Data
This is the third exercise that I have done during the course for "Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" in Udemy. 
In this exercise, we have used an artifical data set with anynomized columns. and we want to predict the "TARGET CLASS" column based on the anynomized columns that we don't know what they are. For this purpose we have used the KNN algorithm.
